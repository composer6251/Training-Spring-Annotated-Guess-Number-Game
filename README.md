# Training-Spring-Annotated-Guess-Number-Game

This repository is for training in the Spring Framework. Specifically in the AnnotatedConfigApplicationContext (as opposed to the 
ClassPathXMLApplicationContext.)

In the Annotated configuration the bean wiring to the container is handled through annotations. 
That is to say the dependency injection is handled by moving the bean configuration into the component class itself.
